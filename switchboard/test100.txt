lot of things that are n't being addressed
what do you find that you use yours mostly for
so that kind of calms him down for the most part
it 's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing where people just want to have whatever will make them feel good right now
so do you think atlanta 's as bad as most other cities
do n't be looking around like you 've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
there are times when you ca n't avoid all that
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
i do n't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it
have you ever served on a jury before
but i have n't
because you 'd probably be too puritanical
and then it was always exciting when we got called to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides just sit in the jury room
and the other people were kind of mixed
they do it with alcohol
you could time it just right
i think it 's a whole trust issue
and i 'm melanie from harrisville utah
but everybody else is centralized in my home town waynesboro

that 's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell is
it 's kind of cold though
i work for the university of new hampshire
no income tax and no sales tax
and we have what we call the five b s for our taxes booze butts cigarettes beds hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling

i do n't know if that 's an excuse for not having a tight budget
have you thought about leasing
i do n't know
i guess i am about eight or nine
i am fairly knowledgeable of
and it 's picked up and actually available at my office
even if it 's not technical if it 's some social thing or whatever it does n't matter
we should cause it does help
i am to both questions
we thought it to be really helpful
and i am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget
just stick to that
i 'm more into older rock like the psychedelic era like
in fact there are people that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that
and they keep on replacing them
it just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans

i agree with both of those things
the only problem i see with term limitations is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is with most governments is just so complex that there is a learning curve and that you ca n't just send someone off to washington and expect his first day to be an effective congress person
but i do n't know
they 're all going
and it 's like
i do n't know what part of new jersey you 're in but i guess it 's fairly industrial
i also read one or two papers a day
i thought it was supposed to give a recording

do they cover diseases like that
i did a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff
they risk their lives every day
i 've heard quotes it 's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works
it 's fast but unreliable

do you have a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
and i 'm on work study

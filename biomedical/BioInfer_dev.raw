Using a complementary sequence or antipeptide to selectively neutralize the stretch of residues 633-642 of skeletal myosin heavy chain , we recently demonstrated that this segment is an actin binding site operating in the absence as in the presence of nucleotide and that this stretch 633-642 is not part of the nucleotide binding site [ Chaussepied &amp; Morales ( 1988 ) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 , 7471-7475 ] .

We report here that tropomyosin , which is found in the rootlet but not in the microvillus core , can bind to and saturate the actin of isolated cores , and can cause the dissociation of up to 30 % of the villin and fimbrin from the cores but does not affect actin binding by 110-kD calmodulin .

{"sentence": "Within 1 hour of raising the concentration of calcium ions , integrins , cadherins , alpha-catenin , beta-catenin , plakoglobin , vinculin and alpha-actinin appeared to accumulate at cell-cell borders , whereas the focal contact proteins , paxillin and talin , did not ."}
{"sentence": "Within the sieve-tube exudate , profilin was present in 15-fold molar excess to actin ."}
{"sentence": "With solutions of actin ( 2 microM ) and thymosin-beta4 ( 2 or 4 microM ) , the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration ( 0.7-2 microM ) ."}
{"sentence": "X-ray structures of isoforms of the actin-binding protein profilin that differ in their affinity for phosphatidylinositol phosphates ."}
{"sentence": "Yeast profilin can sequester yeast actin monomers and thereby reduce the ability of yeast actin to polymerize , whereas it has little effect on the degree of polymerization of rabbit skeletal muscle actin ."}
{"sentence": "Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin ."}
